# Next.js and Redux Blog Application

## Overview

This is a simple blog application built using Next.js and Redux. It provides a platform for users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on blog posts. Each blog post includes a title, content, and a timestamp indicating when it was created.

## Features

- **List and Single Post View**: The homepage lists all the blog posts with pagination, showing a limited number of posts per page. Users can click on a post title to view its full content in the single post view.
